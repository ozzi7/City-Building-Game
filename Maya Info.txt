Open3mod.exe can be used to check models

General maya hacks:
- Ctrl double click in outliner lets you rename objects
- pressing down alt and moving mouse or clicking is used to navigate the scene
- things can be hidden, select and go to display -> hide and display -> show
- select two meshes and go to mesh->combine to combine them
- ctrl a attribute editor
- for walking export frame 0_29
- also center lumby
- fix mesh with mesh -> cleanup before animation

How to export the lumberjack to .dae with an animation sequence (but with low quality animation):
- create new maya scene
- set bottom right to 30 fps
- drag and drop mariolow.obj into maya
- select the complete mesh (via windows-> outliner & shift select)
- select rigging in drop down, then skeleton -> quickrig -> auto rig button
- drag and drop the animation fbx into maya
- in drop down of rigging stuff (which is still open) select source: humanoid1 (animation now works, check with slider..)
- in outliner select quickrigcharacter_reference & all the meshes
- click file -> export selection, select dae/fbx and change settings to bake animation with keyframes so that the complete animation is contained, most likely y should be set as up axis (or Z, actually its random!)
- change the .dae file in text editor, on top change the texture paths to relative ones (relative to dae file)

How to create a better quality animation:
- create maya scene
- set bottom right to 30 fps
- drag and drop lumby_and_axe_mesh
- rigging-> quickrig, step by step, in first step where guides are created, 
- after creating move the guide positions to fit arm length etc.
- create rest including skinning (last step)
- drag and drop walk cycle the fixed one .mb
- apply it.. (charcater: quickrigcharacter and source: inplace_walk blabla) bake it to lumby (blue icon bake to skeleton),
select all frames here! 29 for walk, and then remove it again (not necessary),
if we bake to control rig then we can change the skeleton inside the lumby.. no clue.. 
also then we can constraina locator to a bone.. 
- if we select inplace_walk or whatever we called the imported skeleton we can see it has keyframes and
lines in graph editor
- to resize/resize skeleton select the master node in windows generaral hypergraph hierarchy.. 
- quickrigcharacter_reference is the curly stuff with keyframes (select _hips for example)
- with a specific bone selceced for exmaple elbow, go to graph eidtoor select a curve to change
and enter += 50 in stats field to add 50 to all keyframes, this is saved automaticaly i think
- create joint click on floor or so (twice), then ENTER or RETURN, then connect the joint to another one
(this is all very buggy to do for some reason, but the idea is to shift click the new bone with the two joints
and the hand joint of lumby and go to skeleton -> connect which should merge the joints)
try not parent but normal connect and hit apply, the joint moves yet they are not becoming one for some reason
- move it to the axe or wherever
- create IK handle
- skin -> interactive bind skin or so, and test it out by rotating elbow

To add an axe:
- after baking:
- create a locator
- shift click lumby and locator, select edit parent
- then shift click locator and the last bone node in the hand basicallly, and make constrain parent..

third trial:
start with 3_guides_placed, move the axe in position, generate skin but never combine meshes.. now
arm also moves the axe
