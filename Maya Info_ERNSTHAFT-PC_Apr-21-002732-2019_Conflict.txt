create new maya scene
drag and drop mariolow.obj into maya
Note: Your character mesh needs to be in a Y-up worldspace, facing the Z-axis:
select mesh -> modify -> center pivot (to rotate around center); rotation must be perfect for quickrig, quickrig  does not even try to figure out where legs and arms are.. 

alternative: also quickrig but choose step by step, do first create/update and fix the guides..
select the complete mesh (via windows-> outliner & shift select)
select rigging in drop down, then skeleton -> quickrig -> auto rig button
drag and drop the animation fbx into maya
in drop down of rigging stuff (which is still open) select source: humanoid1 (animation now works, check with slider..)
// maybe click blue icon and bake, bake skeleton.. probably not
in outliner select quickrigcharacter_reference & all the meshes
click file -> export selection, select FBX, import again, then export again as dae/fbx, always set bake animation with keyframes so that the complete animation is contained..
done.. 

change the .dae file in editor, on top change the texture paths to absolute ones (relative to dae file) (copy paste them from another .dae..)


// creating new model
create box, in panels -> ortho we can set it to floor height
use extrude tool to create new vertices.. select face first
